# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer: I never thought about using columns to simplify my algorithm. Also, creating a position class is really useful.

-----

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer: hexagon is the room and the tesselation is the hallway.

-----
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer: initiating the world, and making sure all the tiles are initiated.

-----
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: Hallways should have a width of 1 or 2 tiles, but the width of room is random. They both have random length.
